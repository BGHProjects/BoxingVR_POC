# BoxingVR_POC

Code adapted from FusedVR tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWhwrbQlD6I&ab_channel=FusedVR) to the latest versions of Unity and SteamVR as at 12/1/2021

VR Boxing proof of concept made with Unity/SteamVR for the HTC Vive

Proof of concepts incorporate haptic feedback in the form of vibrations that are triggered when the 'glove' connects with a punchable gameObject within the environment

First proof of concept incorporates a punching bag, which uses a Spring mechanic to simulate the physical effects of it being punched

Second proof of concept is inspired by Punch Bomb VR game, and spawns punchable bombs around the player in a circle at random positions and heights

Refer to "BoxingVR - Punch Bomb Demo" and "BoxingVR - Punching Bag Demo" for demos of the proof of concepts in action
